During the 2019 Summer, I had the opportunity to attend **Summer Innovation Week** by **Critical Software**. I was one of the 25 selected out of over 250 applicants, which made me feel the need to demonstrate that I was worth the opportunity.

## Team Composition

I was placed in a team with three other great individuals from diverse fields such as:

- **Electronics**
- **Mechanics**
- **Physics**

This diversity led to a very balanced team, essential for tackling our challenge.

## The Challenge

Our challenge was to develop a **Self-Balancing Motorcycle**. This proved to be a significant challenge due to the extensive physics and electronics concepts involved. 

### Learning Experience

Working on this project allowed me to:

- Gain exposure to new physics and electronics concepts
- Collaborate effectively with individuals from different technical backgrounds

## Description

Research and attempt to implement a self balancing bike using 2 methods (Steering control and a reactionary wheel), the material used was:
  * PID
  * Kalman Filters
  * MPU 6050 as a sensor
  * Bike developed by @jmrnunes
  * Servo

The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/TomasCostaK/SelfBalancingBike), as well as a showcase [video](https://youtu.be/XtA4d0lyL8M?si=hL9fhbXN9EUsmUzs&t=289).
