MyLife was the last and most complex product me and my colleagues created during our bachelor in University of Aveiro. It is a culmination of several skillsets and teachings along the years.

I worked in a group of five people, and we all had different roles inside the project, but we got to work on all fronts so we would know the project and its components very well.

All the information and documentation can be found here:

## Context

The use of information and communication technologies in the health area is being explored in the most diverse scenarios of diagnosis and treatment of patients.

In the last decade, there has been a proliferation of mobile devices for monitoring vital signs and physical activity of citizens, thus enhancing the emergence of a new paradigm for monitoring clinical conditions and behavioural habits.

On the other hand, it is known that patterns of food consumption have a major impact on health conditions and that more and more citizens are concerned with monitoring their diet, recording the calories and macronutrients they consume and also the calories they spend on physical exercise.

## Problem

Due to the growing demand of the labour market, the day-to-day tasks that increasingly fill citizens' schedules and other activities that make up daily life, people have less and less time to monitor their health and perform activities to promote a good lifestyle.

Various technologies on the market try to assist people in this area by providing tools where it is possible to insert the foods consumed daily, but manual insertion is still time-consuming and takes up a large amount of time.

Gymnasiums and personal trainers try to instil a culture of exercise and a healthy lifestyle in citizens, but the prices and the high number of people who frequent this space end up discouraging many citizens from practising a healthy lifestyle.

To solve this, we proposed the following project calendar:

## Solution

At the end of this project, we had a fully functional application capable of tracking eating habits and physical activity of an individual.

This product was capable of connecting with fitness trackers (Fitbit Charge 3) and other instruments that measured data such as the number of steps walked, heart rate, quality of sleep, steps climbed, and other personal metrics involved in fitness.

The user had the opportunity to track calories, macronutrients and other metrics. By taking a picture of the food, the app automatically logged the calories, proteins, carbohydrates and other metrics for future review by the user.

Besides that, the users could be connected to a doctor that had access to all the food history of the patient so he gave more precise feedback.

Our whole product's use-cases would come to look something like this:
